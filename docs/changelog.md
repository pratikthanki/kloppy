## 1.0.0 (2020-07-26)
In this major release we introduce metadata. The metadata is part of a dataset and can be accessed via `Dataset.metadata`.
There are a couple of breaking changes:

1. All attributes except `records` / `frames` are moved from `Dataset` to `Metadata` class. 
2. All `position` properties are renamed to `coordinates`. 
3. The `players_coordinates` property is indexed by `Player` instances instead of by `jersey_number` strings.
4. On the `Event` class the `player_jersey_number` is replaced by `player` which is a `Player` instance.
5. `to_pandas` changes:
    - `player_jersey_number` is replaced by `player_id`
    - `team` is replaced by `team_id`
    - `position_*` is renamed to `coordinates_*`
    - `player_<home/away>_<jersey_no>_x` is renamed to `<player_id>_x`
